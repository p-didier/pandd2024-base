Repository structure:

* `./package/gui_utils.py`: scripts for the GUI. Not to be modified.
* `./package/general.py`: general functions, not GUI-related. You can add functions to that file to your convenience. Feel free to create other `.py` files as well.
* `./rirs/`: folder where your RIRs and acoustic scenario information will be stored (as Pickle archives: `name.pkl.gz`).
* `./sound_files/`: folder containing provided sound files to conduct your tests.
* `./notebook_skeleton.ipynb`: skeleton notebook to start your work from.
* `./requirements.txt`: package requirements file.
